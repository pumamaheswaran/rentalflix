# rentalflix
This project is a coding challenge which tests proficiency in developing applications using Java. The goal was to implement a movie renting service i.e given IFlix interface, create a class which extends IFlix interface and implement all its methods. The methods include CRUD operations like:

1. Create Movie
2. Delete Movie
3. Update Movie
4. Find all Movies
5. Rent a Movie if it is not rented already

Since our service can be called by multiple different clients, all the operations can be called simultaneously which needs to be handled. This challenge tests if an individual is able to overcome various thread synchronization problems.
